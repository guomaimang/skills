## Tips for Creating Diagrams

### Be Specific

Instead of:
```
Create an architecture diagram
```

Use:
```
Create an AWS architecture diagram with Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB
for a serverless REST API. Use AWS icons.
```

### Mention Visual Elements

- Specify if you want official cloud icons (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Request animated connectors for data flow
- Specify colors or themes if desired

### Describe Relationships

- Explain how components connect
- Describe data flow direction
- Mention security boundaries or zones

### Iterate

Start with a basic diagram and refine:
```
1. "Create a basic microservices architecture"
2. "Add a message queue between services"
3. "Add a cache layer in front of the database"
4. "Add monitoring and logging components"
```

## Common Patterns

### Three-Tier Architecture

```
Presentation Tier (Web/Mobile)
    ↓
Application Tier (Business Logic)
    ↓
Data Tier (Database)
```

### Microservices Pattern

```
API Gateway
    ↓
Service Mesh
    ↓
Individual Services (each with own database)
    ↓
Message Queue (async communication)
```

### Event-Driven Pattern

```
Event Producers
    ↓
Event Bus
    ↓
Event Consumers
    ↓
Event Store
```

### CQRS Pattern

```
Commands → Write Model → Event Store
                            ↓
                        Event Bus
                            ↓
Queries ← Read Model ← Event Handlers
```
